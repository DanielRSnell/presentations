# Cost Comparison: N8N vs Microsoft Solution

## Monthly Fixed Costs

| Component             | N8N Solution       | Microsoft Solution                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Infrastructure        | $76.00 (Azure VPS) | Included in Microsoft licensing                   |
| Backups               | $15.00             | Included in Microsoft licensing                   |
| **Total Fixed Costs** | **$91.00**         | **$0.00** (but absorbed in per-interaction costs) |

## Per-Interaction Costs

| Component               | N8N Solution      | Microsoft Solution                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| CoPilot Message Cost    | $0.02 per message | $0.02 to $0.30 per message                           |
| Average Cost per Ticket | $0.02 per ticket  | $1.25 to $2.00 per ticket (5-8 interactions @ $0.25) |

## Annual Cost Scenario (Based on 6,600 Tickets)

| Metric                            | N8N Solution  | Microsoft Solution          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Fixed Annual Costs                | $1,092.00     | $0.00                       |
| Interaction Costs (6,600 tickets) | $132.00       | $8,250.00 to $13,200.00     |
| **Total Annual Cost**             | **$1,224.00** | **$8,250.00 to $13,200.00** |
| **Average Cost per Ticket**       | **$0.19**     | **$1.25 to $2.00**          |

## Three-Year Cost Projection

| Timeframe                    | N8N Solution  | Microsoft Solution           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Year 1 (6,600 tickets)       | $1,224.00     | $8,250.00 to $13,200.00      |
| Year 2 (assuming 10% growth) | $1,236.00     | $9,075.00 to $14,520.00      |
| Year 3 (assuming 10% growth) | $1,248.60     | $9,982.50 to $15,972.00      |
| **3-Year Total**             | **$3,708.60** | **$27,307.50 to $43,692.00** |

## Cost Comparison Highlights

- **Initial Investment**: The N8N solution requires a fixed infrastructure cost of $91/month regardless of ticket volume.
- **Scaling Economics**: The N8N solution becomes increasingly cost-effective as ticket volume grows.
- **Breakeven Point**: The fixed costs of the N8N solution are offset after processing approximately 73 tickets per month.
- **3-Year Savings**: The N8N approach could save approximately $23,598.90 to $39,983.40 over three years compared to the Microsoft solution.
- **Per-Ticket Efficiency**: The N8N solution costs approximately 85-90% less per ticket than the Microsoft solution.

## Additional Cost Considerations

- The Microsoft solution may require additional licensing costs for Power Apps, Power Automate, and premium connectors.
- The N8N solution leverages open-source components, eliminating licensing fees for workflow automation.
- Infrastructure costs for the N8N solution may increase with scale but at a much slower rate than per-interaction costs.
- The N8N solution offers more predictable budgeting with primarily fixed costs versus variable per-interaction costs.
